This class is currently an on going process. I wrote this while working with realtime data collection using multiple inertial measurment units. 
## Data
The ```raw_data``` contains ```.xlsx``` files of 7 Subjects, with 11 columns. This is to test the class.

## How to run
Navigate the directory and run ```python3 main.py -i FOLDER_TO_READ -o OUTPUT_FOLDER```
or
Use the notebook provided, it's more convenient to work with.

## Future Work
1. Currently adding an ```argument parser``` command line instructions
2. This process is slower than expected, there instead of saving the files as new can be replaced with memory such as the ```keras.preprocessing``` methods.
3. This is a part of a bigger Deep Learning pipeline, therefore in the future I will be converting this to a complete Deep Learning program, deployable on flask.
4. Add more classes -> convert to a package -> publish on PyPi

Figma designs products that are relevant to people in every corner of the world. It provides everyone the equal opportunity to bring their ideas to a visual/practical reality. I know this myself from experience since I have incorporated it in almost every project that I have worked on and I have also encouraged and helped people to use it numerous times. Being a part of a team that can bring the digital revolution to everyone is a dream come true and is my biggest motivation of joining Figma.
